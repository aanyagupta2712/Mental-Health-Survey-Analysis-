# ðŸ§  Mental Health Survey Data Analysis

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes survey data collected from students to study how **sleep duration** and **academic stress** are related.  
As a Psychology student, I wanted to explore how simple data analytics tools can help visualize real mental health trends.

### ðŸ§° Tools Used
- **Excel** â€“ Data cleaning, charts, and analysis  
- **Power BI** â€“ Interactive dashboard creation  
- **Data Source** â€“ Self-collected survey via Google Forms (300+ responses)

### ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Students who sleep 6â€“7 hours reported lower stress levels than those with <5 hours of sleep.  
- Stress levels increased significantly during exam weeks.  
- Visualizing data helped uncover patterns that were hard to see in raw form.

### ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Preview
